                            Big cities are becoming more aware of their growth. For example, London, England is projected to be home to 9.8 million people by 2043, an increase of 800 thousand people when compared with 2021. With that amount of growth, current cities do not have what it takes to make city living.

                            Smart cities use intelligent technology, connected devices, and instantaneous data to solve real-world problems. From reducing energy use to alleviating traffic congestion, smart cities are positively changing the lives of urban residents worldwide.

                        Countries, towns, cities, and governments have realized the potential and impact of smart cities. Investment in smart cities is rapidly growing, as global spending on these revolutionary initiatives and digital technologies are expected to hit $2.6 trillion worldwide by 2026. Additionally, construction jobs in cities across the U.S. are booming to meet this demand.

                        <li>
                        With cost, sustainability, and efficiency benefits, smart city technologies are no longer part of the distant future. They are quickly becoming essential for cities to thrive and support a healthy, ever-growing population.

                        <li>
                            
                            With the right technology and equipment, the construction industry is ready to take the next steps into the future as cities become smarter and more accessible for their citizens.
